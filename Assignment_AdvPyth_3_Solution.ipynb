    "# 1. What is the concept of an abstract superclass?\n",
    "# An abstract class can be considered as a blueprint for other classes. It allows you to create a set of methods that must\n",
    "# be created within any child classes built from the abstract class. A common superclass for several subclasses is called \n",
    "# abstract superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. What happens when a class statement's top level contains a basic assignment statement?\n",
    "# It's called class variable\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Why does a class need to manually call a superclass's __init__ method?\n",
    "# The main reason for always calling super class _init__ is that super class may typically create member variable\n",
    "# and initialize them to defaults. So if you don't call super class init, none of that code would be executed and\n",
    "# you would end up with super class that has no member variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. How can you augment, instead of completely replacing, an inherited method?\n",

    "\n",
    "# 5. How is the local scope of a class different from that of a function?\n",
    "# Local scope is a kind of block scope.Class scope Names of class members have class scope, which extends throughout\n",
    "# the class definition regardless of the point of declaration."
