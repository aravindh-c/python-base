    "# Q1. What is the relationship between classes and modules?\n",
    "# The difference between a class and a module in python is that a class is used to define a blueprint for a given object, \n",
    "# whereas a module is used to reuse a given piece of code inside another program\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. How do you make instances and classes?\n",
    "# Class- Using 'class' keyword.\n",
    "# Instance- Using the class name. Eg. obj=EMP()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3. Where and how should be class attributes created?\n",
    "# class attributes are created within class with 'def' keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4. Where and how are instance attributes created?\n",
    "# An instance attribute is a Python variable belonging to only one object. It is only accessible in the scope of the object \n",
    "# and it is defined inside the constructor function of a class. For example, __init__(self,..).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5. What does the term \"self\" in a Python class mean?\n",
    "# self represents the instance of the class. By using the “self” keyword we can access the attributes and \n",
    "# methods of the class in python. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Q6. How does a Python class handle operator overloading?\n",
    "# Operator Overloading means giving extended meaning beyond their predefined operational meaning. \n",
    "# For example operator + is used to add two integers as well as join two strings and merge two lists.\n",
    "# It is achievable because ‘+’ operator is overloaded by int class and str class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q7. When do you consider allowing operator overloading of your classes?\n",
    "# This feature in Python allows the same operator to have different meaning according to the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q8. What is the most popular form of operator overloading?\n",
    "# Addition (+) operator\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q9. What are the two most important concepts to grasp in order to comprehend Python OOP code?\n",
    "# Inheritance and Polymorphism"
